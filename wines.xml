            <description>From the storied Del Barba vineyard est. in early 1900s, Renowned winemaker Aaron Pott selected
                21 barrels of heirloom grapes that were on a different level than the rest. Lot 21 is deep, full bodied,
                and exploding with complexity--smoky Syrah, juicy Zinfandel, and earthy Cabernet Franc. Only a handful of barrels
                of this wine were ever made. It&apos;s a blend of grapevines that have survived and flourished since before World War I.

            <description>Predominately merlot and Syrah. 13.5% notes: &quot;this polished red wine offers aromas of cherry, red currrant,
                and tea. Flavors of cherries, ripe berries, and plums supported by a frame of refined tannins give way to sybtle notes
                of baking spice on a persistent finish.&quot;</description>
